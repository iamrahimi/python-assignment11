Static vs. Interactive Visualizations:
Static visualizations, such as charts and graphs in printed reports or PDFs, provide a fixed view of data and are useful for conveying clear, snapshot insights. However, they lack the ability to adapt to different queries or data points. In contrast, interactive visualizations allow users to explore data dynamically—zooming, filtering, hovering for details, or selecting subsets—which makes them more flexible and informative, especially when dealing with complex or large datasets.

Advantages of Dashboards for Real-Time Data Exploration:
Dashboards offer an efficient and intuitive way to monitor and analyze real-time data. They aggregate multiple data sources and visualizations into a single interface, allowing users to track key metrics, identify trends, and respond quickly to changes. This makes them particularly valuable in business, operations, and decision-making environments where up-to-date information is crucial.
